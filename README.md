## About the Video Course
In this course, we will focus on implementing DevOps practices in the cloud using an aggregation of very potent tools and services.

This combination of toolsets provides end-to-end capabilities of fully automating your source code builds, testing, and deployment. Implementing these tools and DevOps practices can help us immensely in reducing the risk within our software development lifecycle by catching bugs early and increasing the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost of developing innovative software in any environment - startups and enterprise alike.
